		<h2>About our Product</h2>
		<p>Our device would be able to charge your technology using thermoelectricity, which is a technique of converting heat into electricity. Power stations, when in use, only produce &#x2153; of the energy as the rest is lost in the long process of converting heat into electricity. With thermoelectricity, this process would be more haste and convenient to use during the conversion. A thermoelectric generator works on the basis of transforming heat into electricity in a simpler format called the thermoelectric effect in which the positively charged particles move to the colder end. Additionally, it will also utilize gallium nitride, which is a different composite than silicon which is used in most smartphones and devices for power. To put it in perspective, gallium nitride conducts electricity up to a whopping 1000x more efficient than silicon. Gallium nitride also produces more power in a smaller footprint which allows our company to produce more while remaining affordable at the same time. The packaging costs are also affected and this allows less carbon emissions during factories and exporting.</p>
