		<h2>New Product</h2>
		<p>Have you ever run out of charge on a road-trip or while camping? Yes, you might have access to a portable charger, but what if that runs out of charge? You usually need an ingress to a plug or outlet although others might already be using it, or there is none in sight. Now there is a portable charger which utilizes thermoelectricity! Available for preorder at $64.99!
