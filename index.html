		<h2>About our Product</h2>
		<p>This device would be able to charge your technology using thermoelectricity, which is a technique of converting heat into electricity. Along with that, it will also include gallium nitride, which is a different composite than silicon which is used in most smartphones and devices for power. To put it in perspective, gallium nitride conducts electricity up to a whopping 1000x more efficient than silicon. Silicon gets hot when it is in use, while gallium nitride on the other hand, stays cool which helps make it safer, and more efficient. Gallium nitride also produces more power in a smaller footprint which aids our company to produce more while remaining cheap at the same time. Power stations, when in use, only produce &#x2153; of the energy as the rest is lost in the long process of converting heat into electricity. With thermoelectricity, this process would be much more efficient and convenient to use during the conversion. A thermoelectric generator works on the basis of transforming heat into electricity in a simpler format called the thermoelectric effect in which the positively charged particles move to the colder end. Since our product can run on body heat, you would simply place our portable charge into your pocket, and the charger would receive energy. Meaning you could keep our portable charger on you at all times, as no power outlet would be needed. This solves the problem of your devices running out of power as our charger can be utilized at any given moment.
